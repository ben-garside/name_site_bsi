        <p class="lead">The refurbishment of our building in 2016 will provide dozens of meeting rooms, collaborative spaces and small working rooms.  To personal our workplace, and to reflect the dynamic and agile BSI working environment we want you to name these spaces.  Naming the spaces will help us to find and remember the spaces, inspire our collaborative efforts and make our workspace a more fun place to work.   The suggestions can be as quirky, interesting, unusual or serious as you like. Weâ€™ve suggested some themes that may inspire your ideas. </p>
        <p class="lead">We also want you to suggest a name for our new canteen area on the 1st floor.</p>
		<p class="lead">We will be giving a prize for the best name.</p>
